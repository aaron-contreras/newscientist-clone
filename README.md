# Newscientist Clone

From [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-ruby-on-rails/courses/html-and-css/lessons/positioning-and-floating-elements). I'll be learning to position and size elements by cloning the newscientist article linked in the project's task. Flexbox, Grid, and perhaps Float will be used to accomplish the layout.
